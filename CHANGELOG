Version 0.7.1 (2007.02.27):
	* fixed the error 'overflow during printing' which was caused by Big::FromInt(Int<int_size> value)
	  (the sign has to be set at the end)
	* fixed many small errors
	* added ATan (arctan), ACTan (arc ctan) functions

Version 0.7.0 (2007.02.24):
	* finished support for 64bit platforms
	* added ASin (arcsin), ACos (arccos) functions
	
Version 0.6.4 (2007.01.29):
	* fixed the problem with a sign in the mathematical parser /-(1) was 1/
	* added UInt::AddInt and UInt::SubInt
	* changed UInt::AddOne and UInt::SubOne (much faster now)
	* added UInt::SetBitInWord
	* changed UInt::SetBit (much faster now)
	* UInt::AddTwoUints renamed to UInt::AddTwoInts
	* UInt::FindLeadingBit32 renamed to UInt::FindLeadingBitInWord
	* added UInt::SetBitInWord
	* UInt::Mul64 renamed to UInt::MulTwoWords
	* UInt::Div64 renamed to UInt::DivTwoWords
	* and more small changes in UInt type
	* start adding support for Amd64 (not finished yet) (added ttmathuint64.h)
	
Version 0.6.3 (2007.01.22):
	* position of arguments (x and base) in logarithm functions are swapped
	* it's possible to use any multiplication algorithms in the same time
	  (macros UINT_MUL_VERSION_'X' have gone)
	* added ExceptionInfo, ReferenceError and RuntimeError classes
	* the mess in macros has been cleaned up
	* added TTMATH_RELEASE macro

Version 0.6.2 (2007.01.10):
