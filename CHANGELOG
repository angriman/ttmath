Version 0.8.0 (2007.03.28):
	* added: into the parser: SetFactorialMax()
	* added: DegToDeg(deg, min, sec), DegToRad(deg), DegToRad(deg, min, sec),
	  RadToDeg(rad), Ceil(x), Floor(x), Sqrt(x), Sinh(x), Cosh(x),
	  Tanh(x) /Tgh(x)/, Coth(x) /Ctgh(x)/
	* changed: class Objects in ttmathobjects.h has been completely rewritten,
	  we can change the names of user-defined variables or functions, and the
	  names are case-sensitive now
	* added: class History which is used in functions which take a lot of time
	  during calculating e.g. Factorial(x)
	* added: Tg(x) a wrapper for Tan(x)
	* changed: CTan(x) is Cot(x) now
	* added: Ctg(x) a wrapper for Cot(x) 
	* added: ATg(x) a wrapper for ATan(x)
	* changed: ACTan(x) is ACot(x) now
	* added: ACtg(x) a wrapper for ACot(x)
	* added: UInt::PrintTable() (for debugging etc.)
	* changed: the methods Big::SetPi() Big::SetE() and Big::SetLn2() have
	  been rewritten, now they have 128 32bit words (it's about 1232 valid
	  decimal digits)
	* fixed: previous values from Big::SetPi() Big::SetE() and
	  Big::SetLn2() were not too much accurate (last 2-3 words were wrong)
	* added: Big::SetLn10() (128 32bit words as well)
	* added: macro: TTMATH_BUILTIN_VARIABLES_SIZE which is equal 128u on
	  32bit platforms and 64ul on 64bit platforms (128/2=64)
	* added: macros: TTMATH_PLATFORM32 and TTMATH_PLATFORM64
	* changed: a small optimisation in UInt::Mul2Big()
	* added: at the end of ttmath.h: #include "ttmathparser.h"
	  this is for convenience for a programmer, he can only use #include
	  with ttmath.h even if he uses the parser
	* added: to samples: big.cpp, parser.cpp
	* added/changes/fixed: in copy-constructors and operators= in Int,
	  Uint and Big (more info in the commit log)
	* renamed Big::SetDotOne() into Big::Set05()
	* changes: a few small optimisations in Big
	* deleted: the word 'virtual' from destructors: UInt, Int, Big
	  (types in this library are not projected to be base-classes for
	  another ones derived from them)
	* and more small changes (look at the commit log)	

Version 0.7.2 (2007.03.09):
	* added: Big::Mod - the remainder from a division
	* added: Big::Sgn - the 'sign' from the value (-1,0,1)
	* added: global functions Mod and Sgn too
	* added: checking whether a user gives a correct value of a variable or function
	  (user-defined variables/functions in the mathematical parser)
	* added: into the parser: logical operators: > < >= <= == != && ||
	* added: into the parser: logical functions: and() or() not() if()
	* added: ErrorCode::err_unknown_operator when the parser couldn't read an operator

Version 0.7.1 (2007.02.27):
	* fixed the error 'overflow during printing' which was caused
	  by Big::FromInt(Int<int_size> value) (the sign has to be set at the end)
	* fixed many small errors
	* added ATan (arctan), ACTan (arc ctan) functions

Version 0.7.0 (2007.02.24):
	* finished support for 64bit platforms
	* added ASin (arcsin), ACos (arccos) functions
	
Version 0.6.4 (2007.01.29):
	* fixed the problem with a sign in the mathematical parser /-(1) was 1/
	* added UInt::AddInt and UInt::SubInt
	* changed UInt::AddOne and UInt::SubOne (much faster now)
	* added UInt::SetBitInWord
	* changed UInt::SetBit (much faster now)
	* UInt::AddTwoUints renamed to UInt::AddTwoInts
	* UInt::FindLeadingBit32 renamed to UInt::FindLeadingBitInWord
	* added UInt::SetBitInWord
	* UInt::Mul64 renamed to UInt::MulTwoWords
	* UInt::Div64 renamed to UInt::DivTwoWords
	* and more small changes in UInt type
	* start adding support for Amd64 (not finished yet) (added ttmathuint64.h)
	
Version 0.6.3 (2007.01.22):
	* position of arguments (x and base) in logarithm functions are swapped
	* it's possible to use any multiplication algorithms in the same time
	  (macros UINT_MUL_VERSION_'X' have gone)
	* added ExceptionInfo, ReferenceError and RuntimeError classes
	* the mess in macros has been cleaned up
	* added TTMATH_RELEASE macro

Version 0.6.2 (2007.01.10):
	* New division algorithm (radix b) where b is 2^32
