TODO TTMath Library
===================

* to add operators (or functions) and, or, xor
* to add functions for generating random values
* to add constructors (UInt, Int) for 64bit platforms (constractors which take int and unsigned)
* to add 'history' for functions like 'factorial' which take a lot of time during calculating
